## Getting Started
These are the steps to run this project locally, with your own Stream Feeds configuration.

### Clone This Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/GetStream/flutter-instagram-clone
```

The project folder needs to be renamed in order for `flutter create` to work (dashes "-" in the folder name are not allowed). You can do this however you want. For example, from a bash terminal you can do:
```bash
mv flutter-instagram-clone flutter_instagram_clone
```

### Create Flutter Platform Folders
Run this inside the main folder to generate platform folders.
```
flutter create .
```

### Setup Image Picker Package
Depending on the platform that you're targetting you will need to do some [setup](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker#installation) for the [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) Flutter package. At the time of writing this package only supports **Android**, **iOS** and **Web**.

### Add Keys and Tokens
You will also need to add your **Stream API-Key** and **User Frontend Tokens**. These are marked with TODOs in the codebase. For additional information, see the [blog](https://getstream.io/blog/instagram-clone-flutter/#creating-demo-instagram-users) or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHRB6KGoaV0&t=627s) section on creating user tokens.
